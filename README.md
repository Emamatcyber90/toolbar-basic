# toolbar-basic package

This is a basic add-on package for the [Tool-Bar Package](https://github.com/suda/tool-bar) written by:  [Suda](https://github.com/suda). It's meant to be a really basic toolbar offering practical access to a few of the great features Atom has.

###Functionality:

* New File
* Open File
* Split Pane Right
* Split Pane Down
* Toggle Tree-View
* Markdown Preview
* Settings
* GitHub Login (Opens Default Browser)
* Hide Tool-Bar (To turn back on go to: Packages-->Tool Bar-->Toggle)

####I recommend using the 24px size setting.

You can get away with the 16px setting, but I feel 24px is spot on. 32px is just BIG. You can change these settings in the main tool-bar package settings section. Go to Settings-->Packages-->Tool-Bar. You'll see the "Gear" Icon. That is where you can change things.

###Credits

A big thanks to [Suda](https://github.com/suda) for making the tool-bar package. And for the example code.

And to [CakeCatz](https://github.com/cakecatz) for making the flex-toolbar.
